*[ROCAir](http://rocair.herokuapp.com)* is a simple demo application
demonstrating the benefits of
[progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement)
for both end users and developers

starting from
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/posh"><abbr title="Plain Old Semantic HTML">POSH</abbr></a>
form controls which are augmented by layering CSS and JavaScript on top,
browsers provide us with various benefits such as focus handling, keyboard
controls and accessibility - without us having to reinvent the wheel by
implementing such functionality ourselves (usually in sub-par fashion)

created by [innoQ](https://www.innoq.com), though based on the collective
wisdom of web advocates across the globe
