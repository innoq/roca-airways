# About

The [ROCA Airways online check-in](http://roca-airways.herokuapp.com) is a small demo application
demonstrating the benefits of
[progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement)
for both end users and developers. It is build upon the initial seat picking demo [ROCAir](https://github.com/innoq/rocair) and provides additional examples of how features like client-side validation, AJAX calls or inter-component communication can be implemented based on the principles of progressive enhancement.

Created by [innoQ](https://www.innoq.com), though based on the collective
wisdom of web advocates across the globe.

Originally based on [ROCAir](https://github.com/innoq/rocair), which takes a more minimalist approach.
